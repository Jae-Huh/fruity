This project was made as Sprint 9 of Phase 0 while studying at Enspiral Dev Academy before bootcamp started. 
By this time, the course covered HTML, CSS and JavaSciprt, so this project is made using those three languages.

The goal of this game is to gain the maximum score by growing and picking apples from the tree. Apples give you different points depending on their sizes, and if you water too much, they'll rot and give you negative points.
Happy Apple Picking!
